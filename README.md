# Learning Haskell

I just started looking into Haskell, and I wanted a place to store my work and share it between computers.

I have been interested in, and fascinated by, functional programming ever since having a beer with a friend who told about how [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)) has no built-in looping constructs, and he made me guess and think about how and why it was not necessary. I still remember the moment when I got it, and I still think it's a really good memory.

Well, anyway, this repository is for learning Haskell.

## Getting started

* [Installing GHCI and Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)


## List of my learning resources

I will add links to the learning resources I'm using here.
