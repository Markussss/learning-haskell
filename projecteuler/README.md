# Project Euler problems solved in Haskell

The files will just be named after the ID of the problems from Project Euler.

## 1
I did not like this solution very much, I think I should have maybe written one list comprehension, instead of three different ones and then appending them all together before summing them.

## 2
Here, I went to Stack Overflow in order to find a way to efficiently generate fibonacci numbers. The bottom solution was the first, and the top one was after seeing an example of using zipWith to create an infinite list of fibonacci numbers. I don't understand it properly yet, as I'm still just trying to figure out how list comprehensions are best used.

## 4
I thought this was a really fun and easy problem to solve. I don't have much to say about it.

## 5
I started looking at this problem, but I don't think I have the tools I need quite yet. Need to read a bit more and go back to this one.

## 6
Yet another really fun problem to solve, and I think the solution is very pretty to look at.

## 7

## 8
This is taking forever to run, so I need to find a way to make it better and faster. Although, I like how it looks.
